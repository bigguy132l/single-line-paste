# single-line-paste
This Windows program takes text from the system clipboard, replaces any newlines in the text with spaces, then puts the new text back in the clipboard. No user input required, beyond launching the program.

It works with Unix-style and Mac-style linebreaks (i.e. LF and CR) as well as the Windows default CR-LF linebreaks.
